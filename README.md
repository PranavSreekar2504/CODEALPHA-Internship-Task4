Disease Prediction from Medical Data & Personal Portfolio Website
ðŸ“Œ Internship Project - CODEALPHA

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Disease Prediction from Medical Data â€“ Developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a disease based on patient data.
Personal Portfolio Website â€“ Creating an interactive portfolio to showcase skills, projects, and resume.
ðŸ“Œ Task 1: Disease Prediction from Medical Data
This part involves building a classification model that predicts diseases based on medical records, symptoms, and patient history.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features
Data Preprocessing â€“ Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling.
Classification Algorithms â€“ Implementing Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
Dataset â€“ Using publicly available datasets like Heart Disease, Diabetes, or COVID-19 symptom datasets.
Model Evaluation â€“ Using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.
ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used
Python (Google Colab)
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn
