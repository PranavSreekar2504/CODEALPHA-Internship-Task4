Disease Prediction from Medical Data 
ðŸ“Œ Internship Project - CODEALPHA

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The "Disease Prediction from Medical Data" dataset is a comprehensive collection of medical records designed to facilitate the development of machine learning models for disease prediction. It includes a variety of features such as patient demographics, medical history, laboratory test results, and clinical observations. These features serve as inputs for predictive algorithms aimed at identifying potential health conditions based on the provided data. The dataset is structured to support the training and evaluation of classification models, enabling healthcare professionals and researchers to explore predictive analytics in medical diagnostics.

ðŸ“Œ Task: Disease Prediction from Medical Data
This part involves building a classification model that predicts diseases based on medical records, symptoms, and patient history.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features
Data Preprocessing â€“ Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling.
Classification Algorithms â€“ Implementing Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
Dataset â€“ Using publicly available datasets like Heart Disease, Diabetes, or COVID-19 symptom datasets.
Model Evaluation â€“ Using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.


ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used
Python (Google Colab)
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn
